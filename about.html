<h2>about us:</h2>
<ul>love u so matcha was created in 2017 by a group of
    matcha-loving girls who all worked together on 
    making a happy & fun coffee shop environment. 
    known around school for making some of the best
    drinks and muffins known to this earth, the 
    girls started small by setting up stands every
    so often and selling their yummy treats. with
    drink stand business booming, the girls decided to
    pursue their dreams and create their own matcha &
    coffee shop, love u so matcha. here we are, 5 years
    later, and we couldn't be more happy to put
    smiles on people's faces when they experience
    that first-sip-feeling. :)</ul>
